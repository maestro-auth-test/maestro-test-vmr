// This file configures where the VMR synchronizes the sources from.
// Each development repository has a mapping record which says where the remote repo is,
// what files are in/excluded from the sync, etc.
//
// This file does not contain information about what version of sources is synchronized.
// Please check the source-manifest.json file for that purpose.

  // These defaults are added to all mappings unless `ignoreDefaults: true` is specified
